# emacs-config
    My custom emacs config.
    
    It contains:
    -  LSP Mode
    -  LSP UI
    -  DOOM Emacs Themes
    -  Company Mode
    -  Treemacs
    -  SLY
    
    It also switches indents to 4 spaces and removes the scrollbar and menubar for an overall cleaner look.

    An LSP server is required to use LSP Mode. Clangd is a solid option for C/C++.
    
    More packages will probably be added soon as I find packages that are useful for my workflow of Lisp and C/C++.
